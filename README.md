# PrivyPulse

## Project Overview
PrivyPulse is a privacy-first, adaptive AI platform designed to demonstrate modern AI system design at an industry level. The system combines a multi-agent workflow architecture, real-time adaptive behavior, and privacy-preserving machine learning to solve complex information tasks without ever collecting or centralizing raw user data.

This repository documents **Phase 0: Vision Lock & Scope Definition**, which establishes the product direction, MVP boundaries, and success criteria before any implementation begins.

## Problem
Most AI systems today are:
- Monolithic, relying on a single model to handle many different tasks
- Static, with limited ability to adapt to real user behavior after deployment
- Dependent on centralized user data collection, creating privacy and security risks

These limitations result in tools that are generic, inflexible, and unsuitable for privacy-sensitive or user-centric applications.

---

## Solution
PrivyPulse addresses these issues by:
- Using a **multi-agent architecture**, where specialized agents collaborate to solve different parts of a task
- Adapting outputs and interface behavior based on observed user interactions over time
- Leveraging **privacy-preserving learning techniques** (e.g., federated learning) so that raw user data never leaves its local environment

The result is an AI system that is collaborative, adaptive, and privacy-first by design.

## MVP Use Case (Locked)
**Privacy-Preserving Market Research Assistant**

The MVP will demonstrate how PrivyPulse can:
- Accept market or trend-related questions
- Decompose tasks across multiple AI agents
- Generate structured insights collaboratively
- Adapt recommendations based on user interaction
- Improve learning outcomes without storing personal data

This use case is fixed for the MVP and will not be expanded during development.

---

## Core Demo Flow (Locked)
1. A user submits a research question
2. A coordinator agent breaks the task into subtasks
3. Specialized agents perform data retrieval, analysis, and synthesis
4. A validation step ensures output quality
5. Results are presented to the user
6. User interactions are logged
7. The system adapts future behavior based on interaction patterns
8. A visual explanation highlights how privacy-preserving learning works

This flow defines the primary demo scenario and will remain unchanged.

## MVP Feature Scope

### Included
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Adaptive behavior based on user interaction
- Privacy-preserving learning (federated or simulated)
- Clear privacy explanations
- System metrics and monitoring

### Explicitly Excluded
- User authentication or accounts
- Payments or monetization
- Mobile applications
- Non-essential UI animations
- Additional product verticals or use cases

---

## Success Criteria
The MVP is considered successful if:
- A non-technical user can understand the system within 60 seconds
- The system demonstrates visible adaptation over time
- Privacy-preserving learning is clearly communicated and measurable
- The full workflow runs end-to-end without manual intervention
- The project can be confidently demoed live

---

## Phase 0 Constraints
- Phase 0 is strictly limited to vision, scope, and design decisions
- No production code is written during this phase
- All decisions documented here are considered locked unless critical issues arise

---

## Phase 0 Deliverables
- Defined problem and solution
- Locked MVP use case
- Fixed demo flow
- Feature inclusion and exclusion list
- Clear success metrics

All future development phases must align with this document.
